## TODO

- Sterilize user input
- Integrate Cloudinary with the back-end to support signed uploads - needed for overwriting existing files (to avoid accumulating obsolete files)

## Issues

- Tried code-spliting by lazy-loading pages in the `routes` files but they got bundled anyway
- Also tried lazy-loading the `routes` arrays but it didn't seem to be supported

## Licence

UNLICENCED
